                                                            Well, you can use your IPTV subscription on multiple
                                                            devices. However, you will only be able to watch the
                                                            channels
                                                            content on one device only at the same time.

                                                            What are the payment options?

                                                            When will I get my subscription activated?

                                                            you receive login credentials. You might or might not be

                                                            How can I check the IPTV device?

                                                            As the first thing, you need to ensure that activation
                                                            details are correct.
                                                            Then you need to make sure that the internet connection is
                                                            working.
                                                            Make sure that other devices connected to the network, such
                                                            as your laptop is not overloading the network and consuming
                                                            bandwidth.
                                                            Ensure having a download speed of at least 4Mbps and upload
                                                            speed of 1Mbps.
                                                            Reboot the device, wait for 30 seconds and turn it on.
                                                            Kindly make sure that you have connected the device to
                                                            router via Ethernet cable, instead of Wi-Fi.
                                                            If there is an issue with connection, you should double
                                                            check credentials on another device.
                                                            You can visit whatismyip.com, copy your IPD address and send
                                                            us to restore.
                                                            Check if the device has got latest firmware updates and app
                                                            has got latest software updates.
                                                            Double check the download speed on your computer.
                                                            Check if there are any bandwidth consuming apps are running.
                                                            If so, you need to quit them.
                                                            Connect with your ISP and see if there is an issue in your
                                                            area.
                                                            Try to uninstall and reinstall the app.

                                                            My channels are not working. What should I do?

                                                            We are looking forward to provide you with the best possible
                                                            service at all times. Therefore, we ensure that content is
                                                            streamed to you at all times.
                                                            If your channels are not working, you can try the following
                                                            methods.

                                                            Wait for several minutes and see. We will do a reboot or
                                                            swap the channels if required.
                                                            Then you need to check if you are having the issue with only
                                                            one channel or all channels.
                                                            Try rebooting your the device. You should wait for 30
                                                            seconds before turning it on.
                                                            Ensure connecting your device to the internet via an
                                                            Ethernet cable.

                                                            What should I do with channel issues?

                                                            If you are having an issue with a channel, you need to
                                                            switch to another channel. This happens due to issues from
                                                            the
                                                            channel provider, which are beyond our control. You can take
                                                            a look back at the channel after some time and it will
                                                            work.

                                                            I see buffering on channels. What could be the reason?

                                                            High internet traffic or slow internet speeds is the main
                                                            reason behind this. If someone in your house is using the
                                                            broadband connection to download or upload something, this
                                                            can happen. You need to disconnect all users from the
                                                            broadband connection and try again.

                                                            On the other hand, you need to make sure that your device is
                                                            connected to internet via a direct LAN Ethernet connection.
                                                            If you are on Wi-Fi, there is a high possibility for you to
                                                            see buffering. If this is not possible, you should move the
                                                            device closer to the router.

                                                            All my channels are blank. What should I do?

                                                            In case if you are using a AVOV or MAG set top box, you will
                                                            need to do a hard reset in the device. You can do this on
                                                            your own. All you have to do is to turn it off, unplug and
                                                            replug.

                                                            If you are on Kodi, you should clear your cache. Or else,
                                                            you can even re-install Kodi.

                                                            Some channels provide only sounds. What should I do?

                                                            This happens due to an issue with settings.

                                                            You need to go to settings in the device or app. Then you
                                                            need to select Native as Decoder. You can do a restart and
                                                            you
                                                            will see videos with sounds.

                                                            You need to check if your account is being used on another

                                                            My account is not working on the STB or MAG BOX Emulator.
                                                            Why is it?

                                                            Firstly, you should check if you have entered the correct
                                                            MAC address.
                                                            Secondly, you should ensure that there is recommended
                                                            internet speed.
                                                            Thirdly, you need to get the device wired to the router.
                                                            You need to ensure that specs of the device are powerful
                                                            enough for streaming.
                                                            If you are using a STB emulator, you should setup it
                                                            accordingly.
                                                            Wipe the cache in your STB emulator.
                                                            If you are using a MAG BOX, you should restart it.
